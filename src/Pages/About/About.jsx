    <p>
      I am a web dev lover from Mali(West Africa), actually living in Russia. I
      started learning code with Python (basic) and then HTML, CSS and so on..
      In 2015 I discovered and fall in love with JavaScript, from then it became
      my second favorite coding language. I love sport (dance and football) and
      online gaming, actually Paladins is my favorite one.
